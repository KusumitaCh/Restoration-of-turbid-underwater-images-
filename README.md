# Underwater Image Enhancement
This project improves underwater image clarity using OpenCV filters and game-theoretic optimization.  

## Features
- CLAHE, dehazing, white-balancing, noise reduction
- Game-theoretic min-max model for filter sequencing
- PSNR & SSIM evaluation

## Results
- Best method: Contrast stretching  
- PSNR: 21.43  
- SSIM: 0.97  

## How to Run
1. Clone this repo
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
